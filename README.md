# About Me

Hi eveyone! My name is Phoebe, I'm the second year master student at CMU major in Healthcare Analytics and Information Technology. I love baking, reading and coding! I was the ex-global patient safety intern at Amgen, I want to use data scientist and  machine learning to create a better world. 

# What I hope to Learn

I want to learn more about the data visulization. I want to be a story teller not just programmer. I also want to learn a little bit about design for the Web Page.
I also want to learn how to build a bridge between the audiance and the data scientist.
