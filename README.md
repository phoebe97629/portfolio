# About Me

Hi eveyone! My name is Phoebe, I'm the second year master student at CMU major in Healthcare Analytics and Information Technology. I love baking, reading and coding! 

# What I hope to Learn

I want to learn more about the data visulization. I want to be a story teller not just programmer. I also want to learn a little bit about design for PPT and Web Page.

# Visualizing Government Debt
How does Asian government deal with debt in 2020.
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bmi" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bmi" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, 2020</a></iframe>
Using Flourish Visualizing Tool
Grid Style:
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8567284"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
Animation style:
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/8567575"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

For the grid style chart: 
Since it's for government debt, I used red as the base color. I used a grid line chart to show how the debt varies from 1995 to 2019 from different countries. I also added a title to the chart, which states what is y-axis represents (debt in % of GDP). I also added year labels on the graph. Instead of adding a y-axis value, I decided to show the year on each grid chart. Because I believe people will focus more on which year has highest the debt, rather than what's the highest value of debt. 

For the animation style: 
This chart is for the audience who want to see how the debt varied these years. The circle size represents the %of the debt, and each circle represents one country. Animation is a good way to show the trend by year.
