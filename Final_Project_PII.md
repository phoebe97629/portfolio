# Final Project Part II (Impact of Period Poverty) 

## wireframing / storyboards.  

“Period Poverty” has long been a neglected public health problem in the US. The brutal reality is that there are approximately 16.9 million females who are suffering from period poverty, which is around 11.2% of the entire female population in the US.

Although 11.2% might seem to be a small chunk of the population, what behind this number is 16.9 million female individuals who are experiencing unimaginable pain in their daily life. Due to finanial factors, these poor individuals could not get access to female hygine products, which lead to trauma both physically and mentally. 
 
Let's take a closer look at the elephant in the room. According to a survey conducted to teenager girls who are currently suffering period poverity in the US in 2021, those who are suffering from period poverty are experiencing the following dilemma in life: 
        - Wear period products longer than recommended
        - Choose to buy period products over other essential things (food or cloth)
        - Struggle to afford period products.

What's worse is that period poverty is not only affecting their personal hygiene, but also their mental health. According to the graph below, those who are in period poverty are also suffering mental stress including period shame, especially self-conscious of period, don't want to be at school, etc.

The reason why period poverty is happending is due to the unresonable tampon tax tampon price. The tampon tax can bring a huge financial benefits for many states. Expecially since those products could never ve substituded.

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1645500486219');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

In recognizing the problems, many states have started making changes. NY cancelled tampon tax on 2020, followed by many other states. There are also many sustainable substitutes available for those who are living in the states where maternity products are highly taxed.
