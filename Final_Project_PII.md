# Final Project Part II (Impact of Period Poverty) 

## wireframing / storyboards.  

“Period Poverty” has long been a neglected public health problem in the US. The brutal reality is that there are approximately 16.9 million females who are suffering from period poverty, which is around 11.2% of the entire female population in the US.

Although 11.2% might seem to be a small chunk of the population, what behind this number is 16.9 million female individuals who are experiencing unimaginable pain in their daily life. Due to finanial factors, these poor individuals could not get access to female hygine products, which lead to trauma both physically and mentally. 
 
Let's take a closer look at the elephant in the room. According to a survey conducted to teenager girls who are currently suffering period poverity in the US in 2021, those who are suffering from period poverty are experiencing the following dilemma in life: 
        - Wear period products longer than recommended
        - Choose to buy period products over other essential things (food or cloth)
        - Struggle to afford period products.

What's worse is that period poverty is not only affecting their personal hygiene, but also their mental health. According to the graph below, those who are in period poverty are also suffering mental stress including period shame, especially self-conscious of period, don't want to be at school, etc.

The reason why period poverty is happending is due to the unresonable tampon tax tampon price. The tampon tax can bring a huge financial benefits for many states. Expecially since those products could never be substituded. From the below chart we can see that, some of the states still imposed the tampon tax. At Texas, the tax revenue of female hygiene products is reached to 24,898,771 USD, compared to the reality that 17% of female and girls living the poverty in Texas.

In recognizing the problems, many states have started making changes. NY cancelled tampon tax on 2020, followed by many other states. 
For those who are living in the states where maternity products are highly taxed, there are also many sustainable substitutes available which can siginicantly reduce the cost on female hygienen products. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8774238"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The sustainbale substitutes has the higher unit price than traditional female hygienen products for sure. However, period cups are durable and can last for 6 months to 10 years with proper care. If we calcualte the yearly cost of the female hygienen products, period cups only cost $20 yearly, the tampon / pads will cost almost $100 dollar yearly. 

Call to Action: 
For all the US citizents, we need aware the issue and push forward legislation for eliminating tax on maternity products. Stop period shaming. Offer love to those who are suffering. 


## Interview. 
1. How do you feel the clarity of the topic? 
2. Who do you think the audiance can be?
3. Does the visulization makes sense to you? Is there anything you don't understand? 
4. Does the storyline makes sense to you? What are you expect to see in the the particular sections? 
5. How do you like this topic? What would you add if you are doing the same topic? 
6. Does this presentation makes you want to take an action? 


Interview Summary: 
First person: 
"I believe this portfolio can be improved significantly if following a deliberate narrative structure (a narrative arc to be precise). I don’t see a clear narrative structure in the current version. By switching up the order of the narrative, this report can convey a much more compelling message. 
To follow a narrative structure, I believe the opening should put more focus on defining what period poverty is. The “Share of US teenager students who experienced period poverty” graph can be used as a good demonstration. 
For the middle part of the narrative structure, the presenter should focus on demonstrating how bad the situation is. The climax should convey the message of “we are in real trouble” as the presenter put together the narrative step-by-step to reach that pinnacle. 
Last but not least, the conclusion part should wrap up the problems and provide solutions for the future. 
The presentation could also benefit a ton by choosing the right format for the graphics. For instance, when conveying the message of “there are 16.9 million people who are currently suffering from period poverty”, pie chart might not be the best choice as it puts emphasis on how small the portion of females who are experiencing the issue. The presenter should try to persuade the audience that “16.9 million is a big number” instead of “only 11.2% of the whole population is impacted by the issue”. "

Second Person: 
"Overall I like this topic and the storyline makes sense to me. I believe the order of the last two graphs could switch the order. The last chart can be set as second one. 
The graph can be improved is if adding the labeles and highlighted what you want the audiance want to see. For the second graph, I belive the percentage is not quit important and maybe use bubble chart is a better option, the text is not clear. For the call on action, since we, as the audiance, cannot change the tax. The action could be more specific to the audiance you choose. " 

Third Person; 
"From the beginning, I think you forgot importance of this topic. Something impactful to grab audience attention. Hard for audience follow what I’m trying to say. Change the words of “period”. They might not fully understand the words, more professional. (change to female hygiene for the whole presentation). Why this problem is important. The graph is missing labels. Revenue for each state. Put number in front of it. Some of the graph is missing titles. Just focus on the products that most commonly used. Make the description on the right side. And only show the percentage of each sectors. 
3.	Make sense. Just need more explaination on the tax. And what means to female. 
4.	The topic is important. 
5.	Yes"


Summary: 
Most of the interviewees want to feel like the draft storyline could be better if I switch the graph order. Also, the graph should highlight the crucial/important part. The audiance isn't clear when I first show them, but I changed the call to action for the citizen of the US to push forward legislation for eliminating tax on maternity products.
