You might still think it is just a small chuck of populatin, and it might not be a big deal. But for the the people who are currently experiencing this problem, it might be a desater to their life. 

Lack of female hygine products can lead to many probelms, both physically and mentally.  
Let's take a closer look for the tennager girl. Period poverty can be divided into three major categories, the person can be struggled to afford period products, have to make selection between food products and period products, nad have to worn period products longer than recommended. And over half percent of teenager girls said that they have to worn period products longer than the recommended due to lack of money to purchase these esstial supplies.

What it worse, it that period poverty not only affect these girls persnal health, but also their study. Most of teenagers will feel shameful when they at school due to lack of period products. They will also struggle on ther school work and don't want to be at school.

The reason why period poverty is happending is due to the unresonable tampon tax tampon price. The tampon tax can bring a huge financial benefits for each states. Expecially those products will always be purchased and with not subastitude.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1645500486219');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

The good news is, many states start makes a change. NY cancel the tampon tax on 2020, and there are many states plan to do that. For the people who haven't benefit from the tax-free period products, they can also purchase the sustainable substitude.
