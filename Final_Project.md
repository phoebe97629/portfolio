# Final Prject. (Period Poverty) 

## An outline

The main purpose of this project is to let the audience understand the definition of period poverty and how this public health crisis influences females living in the United States.

“Period Poverty” has long been a neglected topic. For people who are not menstruating and the people never suffering period poverty, they can barely empathize with the people who are currently experiencing period poverty.

There is half of the population menstruating. However, the brutal reality is that <font color="red"> one in four people struggle to purchase period supplies due to lack of income. This is called period poverty. <font> 

This public health crisis is suffered by different age groups. However, for college-aged women, the impact is even worse. <font color="red"> Among the sample, 14.2% of women had experienced period poverty ever in the past year; an additional 10% experienced it every month. <font> Compared to those who had never experienced period poverty, the adjusted analysis revealed that women with monthly past-year period poverty were the most likely to report <font color="red">moderate/severe depression (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09–4.99), followed by those who had experienced it ever in the past year (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI, 0.99–3.38). <font> (Lauren F. 2021)

The cause of the period poverty can be varied. One of the major issues is “tampon tax”. The “luxury tax” collected on menstrual products in the majority of the United States is a major contributor to period poverty and a barrier to reproductive health for the estimated 16.9 million women living in poverty in the U.S. 
As of June 2019, <font color="red"> thirty-five states taxed menstrual products at rates between 4.70%; in Hawaii to 9.90%; in Louisiana, with a mean of 7.41%. Among them, nineteen states taxed between 6 and 7.99%, twelve at >8%, and only four states at <6%. <font> This financial burden decreased the accessibility of menstrual products specifically for the marginalized low-income women and women with heavy menstrual bleeding. The lack of access to menstrual products led to poor menstrual hygiene, decreased participation in work and other activities, and contributed to poor quality of life.

There are many low-cost sustainable period supplies for women to choose from, which alleviate this crisis. 
1. Menstrual cups can last up to a decade because they are made of medical-grade silicone, rubber, or latex. If prices stayed consistent over 10 years, women who used a $23 menstrual cup would <font color="red"> save 95% of what they would likely spend on pads, and about 93% of what they would likely spend on tampons during that time, according to the researchers’ calculations.<font>
2. Like disposable products, period underwear can also be designed to fit your flow. While it's not as cost-effective as a cup (one pair of panties won't see you through your whole flow unless you're really determined to do laundry every day), the investment can still save you some cash. Most period underwear costs around $36. For a five-day flow, without laundry, you'll spend $175. If you take good care of your new underwear, over three years, <font color="red"> you'll have spent less than $5 per period. Given that a box of name-brand tampons runs around $10, that's not a bad deal. <font>


Conclusion:
Many young women cannot afford menstrual health products to meet their monthly needs, and this may impact their mental well-being. Improved access to affordable menstrual products is needed to support these young women.

Basic strucutre: 
1. Beginning: What is period poverty, and how many people suffering this public healht crisis. (unhappy)
2. Impact1: Show hom this crisis suffered by differnet age groups and the different impact to them. (unhappy)
2. Reason: Explian the reason cuased the period poverty. Show how different "tampon tax" imposed by different states at the US. (unhappy) 
3. Solution: Show how sustainbal period supplied can alliviate period poverty. (happy)

I hope after the presentation, the audience will know why period poverty is one of the major issues in public health in the US, and how we can help them.


## Initial sketches
We've begun to explore how sketching can be a great way to help solidify your ideas into design choices, and for your proposal you'll be creating sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project.  You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion you feel makes the most sense - but they should be clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic and follow aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.).   Show both your anticipated data visualizations as well as major elements of your story itself (e.g key headers, etc.)

## The data

It's important that you identify your primary data source.  To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

## Method and medium

In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story.
