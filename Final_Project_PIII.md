# Final Project Part III

## PartI.  

For part I, I did a lot of research on the topic. I first came out with several ideas and finally chose the Period Poverty issues in the US. 
To form the original sketch, I firstly did a lot of fo research on the website and tried to understand why period poverty happened, and how this public health crisis affect each individual. 
After I got the main idea, I made some simple sketches of the visualizations and tried to find the data based on what kind of graph I want to make. 
However, I found that it is really hard to get first-hand data. Even though there are lots of websites talking about this topic, they didn't state where they get these data. So I spend a lot of time doing the "data hunting". 

## Part II. 
After the first part was finished, I got a lot of feedback from my classmates, they also provide extra data sources which help me to construct the data visualization. 
I used Flourish and Tableau to do the wireframe and tried to put everything together to form a story. 
After I constructed the draft for the final projects, I interviewed three people and asked about where I should improve and what they expect to see for this topic. 
The interviewees mentioned that the storylines are not very clear, and some of the graphs do not strongly support the topic. 
They also mentioned the call to action is not strong and they are expecting what they can actually help those people. 

## Final part. 
I first changed the color theme for some of my graphs, and make them consistent. 
I switched the graph order and put the definition at the very beginning. I also added some graphs, like the cost comparison between the taxed-tampon and non-taxed tampon. 
Finally fo the call to action, 
I added some resources for the audience who want to the people and push the tax-free period movement.

Summary: 
From this final assignment, I actually learned a lot from my classmates. Especially about how to form a stron call to action and the storyline. I feel like listening to the audiance is verty important
when I try to create a visulization project.
