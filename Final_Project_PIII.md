# Final Project Part III

## PartI.  

For part I, I did a lot of research on the topic. I first came out with several ideas and finally chose the Period Poverty issues in the US. 
To form the original sketch, I firstly did a lot of fo research on the website and tried to understand why period poverty happened, and how this public health crisis affect each individual. 
After I got the main idea, I made some simple sketches of the visualizations and tried to find the data based on what kind of graph I want to make. 
However, I found that it is really hard to get first-hand data. Even though there are lots of websites talking about this topic, they didn't state where they get these data. So I spend a lot of time doing the "data hunting". 

## Part II. 
After the first part was finished, I got a lot of feedback from my classmates, they also provide extra data sources which help me to construct the data visualization. 
I used Flourish and Tableau to do the wireframe and tried to put everything together to form a story. 
After I constructed the draft for the final projects, I interviewed three people and asked about where I should improve and what they expect to see for this topic. 
The interviewees mentioned that the storylines are not very clear, and some of the graphs do not strongly support the topic. 
They also mentioned the call to action is not strong and they are expecting what they can actually help those people. 

## Final part (Part III). 
The insight of the PART II interview: 
my storyline is not very clear, and some of the people said that the graph doesn't strongly support my topic. For example, in Part II I used the pie chart, which how 11.% is just a small portion. 
What I did for the final part:
For the population pie chart, I use two Virginia pictures to represent how huge is 16.9 million is. I added some charts. For example, the map I used in Part II shows the aggregate Tax revenue by each state. But for people, it might now be very intuitive. After I showed the aggregate tax revenue, I also showed the yearly cost of female hyginen products before tax and after tax chart to represent how the high tampon tax actually affects individuals. I believe this chart can give the audience a more intuitive impression of how high the tampon tax is in the US. I also changed the color theme for some of my graphs, make them consistent, and switch a graph order a little bit.

After the presentation, I also added two buttons for the audience. This provides a direct resource for the audience and helps them to take an action.
I re-think about the audience that I want to talk to. For this presentation, I'm targetting two groups of people. First is the regular US citizens who don't have the period poverty issues. This presentation (visualization project) will let them aware of these huge public health problems. And then by showing the high tampon tax, those people can choose to join the Tax-Free Period movement to help the people who have period poverty issues. The second group of audience is the people who are suffering the period poverty. They can firstly know that people are taking action right now, and then they will know how to reduce these costs by switching to using sustainable female hygiene products.

## Summary: 
From this final assignment, I actually learned a lot from my classmates. Especially about how to form a stron call to action and the storyline. I feel like listening to the audiance is verty important when people try to create a visulization project.
